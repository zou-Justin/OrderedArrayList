# OrderedArrayList
Group discussion
If the number is null then just throw the exception. Misconception was that we would need instance variables but we do not. Someone asked if we could use sort() built in methods, and the answer is no.  Super.add() to call the old method. We discuss how to compare equal strings. Maybe something with comparing ascii value. Perhaps postpone adding the greatest value until the end. Sort would be having an array list full of integers with indexes allowing us to make a new arraylist using the previous array list.
